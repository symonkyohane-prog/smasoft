    <h1>Bachelor of Science in Computer Systems and Security (2019-2024)</h1><br>
    <h3>Malawi University of Science and Technology</h3><br><hr>
<h1>Rationale for the Programme</h1><br>
<p>Computer systems and security play an important role in supporting commerce, banking,
telecommunication, health care and other socio-economic agendas.  However, system
breaches and failures have the potential to undermine the safety and viability of industrial
and commercial systems, fuel criminal activity and endanger human life</p><br>
<p>While the 21st century has witnessed a technological revolution brought about by the
integration of computer technology in almost every aspect of life, security challenges
inherent in computer hardware and software are on the increase. Worldwide, computer
systems are falling victim to a unique variety of security breaches that usually have
profound negative social, economic and legal implications.</p><br>
<p>Since Malawi is not spared from falling victim to these security breaches and given the
rate at which Malawi is adopting these advances in computer technology, it is imperative
that a programme that will train computer systems security professionals be developed to
impart necessary knowledge and skills to safeguard computer systems from vulnerabilities
and security breaches.</p><br>
<p>The purpose of this programme is to provide comprehensive academic training required
by security professionals in order to select, develop, implement and manage computer
systems security solutions. The programme also focuses on imparting knowledge of core
non-technical issues of security such as social, economic, legal, regulatory and ethical
considerations and related implications.</p><br><hr>
<h1>Educational Aims of the Programme</h1><br>
<p>The main aim of this programme is to produce high-caliber graduates with capabilities to
understand and develop secure computer systems</p><br><hr>
